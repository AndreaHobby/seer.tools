Tools to download and use SEER data from NCI

## Oveview  
Simple tools to download and use SEER data from NCI.  Very early prototype.  Works with 2016 release of 1973-2013 data that was released on April 15, 2016.  Use with caution.  This original functions were tested on a Mac, but there are issues with Windows in downloading files from the internet.  Therefore, those functions may or may not work properly.  

We will continue to work on this package to improve the functions.
